EPIC
JIRA-ARCH-000 - Architecture Review and Clean Code Implementation
Type: Epic
Priority: P0
Status: IN PROGRESS
Assignee: Team
Estimate: Multi-sprint
Context:
- Mixed Layered/Hexagonal boundaries with unclear responsibilities.
- Goal: enforce SOLID, reduce duplication, and stabilize boundaries.
Scope:
- Drive architecture decisions, refactors, and test strategy.
- Enforce package dependency rules and separation of concerns.
Acceptance:
- Architecture target documented and enforced by tests.
- Core services and controllers respect SRP and DIP.
Dependencies: none

P0 - CRITICAL
JIRA-ARCH-002 - Separate responsibilities (Controllers/Entities/Services)
Type: Task
Priority: P0
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 8h
Context:
- Controllers still contain orchestration and business logic.
- GameController (293 lines - DONE) and DraftController (494 lines) violate SRP.
Steps:
1) Inventory business logic in controllers and entities.
2) Move business logic to services/use cases.
3) Keep controllers as routing + validation only.
4) Extract domain rules from JPA entities.
Acceptance:
- Controllers contain no orchestration logic.
- Business rules live in services/use cases.
- Unit tests run without Spring context.
Dependencies:
- JIRA-ARCH-000

P1 - HIGH
JIRA-ARCH-003 - Invert dependencies (use cases -> ports)
Type: Task
Priority: P1
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 6h
Context:
- Use cases still depend on concrete repositories.
Steps:
1) Define repository interfaces (ports) for core use cases.
2) Implement adapters in infrastructure.
3) Swap use cases to depend on interfaces only.
4) Enforce dependency rules in ArchUnit tests.
Acceptance:
- Use cases depend only on abstractions.
- ArchUnit rules enforce DIP.
Dependencies:
- JIRA-ARCH-000

JIRA-ARCH-004 - Reduce coupling
Type: Task
Priority: P1
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 8h
Context:
- Classes with too many dependencies indicate low cohesion.
Steps:
1) Identify classes with >7 dependencies.
2) Extract focused services or strategies.
3) Reduce cross-cutting dependency graphs.
Acceptance:
- Each class has a single responsibility and fewer dependencies.
Dependencies:
- JIRA-ARCH-000

JIRA-ARCH-005 - Isolate domain
Type: Task
Priority: P1
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 12h
Context:
- Domain logic is coupled to JPA entities.
Steps:
1) Create pure domain objects (no persistence annotations).
2) Add mappers Entity <-> Domain.
3) Move rules from entities into domain/services.
Acceptance:
- Domain layer independent from persistence.
Dependencies:
- JIRA-ARCH-000

JIRA-ARCH-007 - Remove parallel paths
Type: Task
Priority: P1
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 6h
Context:
- Multiple execution paths for the same operations (Game/Draft/Trade).
Steps:
1) Map current flows (controllers/services/use cases).
2) Choose a canonical path per operation.
3) Delete unused branches.
Acceptance:
- Single path per operation.
Dependencies:
- JIRA-ARCH-000

JIRA-ARCH-008 - Reduce structural debt
Type: Task
Priority: P1
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 8h
Context:
- Dead code in core/domain and permissive architecture tests.
Steps:
1) Remove unused core/domain packages.
2) Tighten architecture tests.
3) Unify seeding logic.
Acceptance:
- No dead code; architecture rules enforced.
Dependencies:
- JIRA-ARCH-000

JIRA-REFACTOR-002 - Split DataInitializationService (658 lines -> 5 services)
Type: Refactoring
Priority: P1
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 6h
Context:
- DataInitializationService is oversized and mixes multiple concerns.
Steps:
1) Extract CSV ingestion into CsvInitializationService.
2) Extract seed loading into SeedInitializationService.
3) Extract game creation into GameInitializationService.
4) Extract validation/checks into ValidationInitializationService.
5) Update wiring and tests.
Acceptance:
- Each service <= 500 lines and SRP compliant.
- Unit tests cover nominal + edges.
Dependencies:
- JIRA-ARCH-000

P2 - MEDIUM
JIRA-SUPABASE-001 - Configure Supabase
Type: Task
Priority: P2
Status: TODO
Assignee: AVAILABLE
Estimate: 2h
Context:
- Supabase variables not configured; remote flows unvalidated.
Steps:
1) Set SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SCHEMA, SUPABASE_SEED_GAME_ID.
2) Run seed/health check.
3) Validate dependent endpoints.
Acceptance:
- Supabase connectivity verified.
- Seed completed and endpoints return data.
Dependencies: none

P3 - LOW
